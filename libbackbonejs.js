 * BackboneJS is a light weight JavaScript library that allows to develop and structure client side applications 
 * that run in a web browser. It offers MVC framework which abstracts 
 * data into models, DOM (Document Object Model) into views 
 * and bind these two using events.
 * BackboneJS was developed by Jeremy Ashkenas and was initially released on October 13th, 2010 
 * It manages the data model which includes the user data and displays that data at the server side with the same 
 * format written at the client side. 
 * BackboneJS has a soft dependency with jQuery and a hard dependency with Underscore.js.
